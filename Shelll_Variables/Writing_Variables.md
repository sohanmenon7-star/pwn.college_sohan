# Challenge 2 : Writing Variables
The challenge asks you to set the variable to a specific value using the `=`

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QigPteLjlqqLB1RoQwzUomWvFKT.QX5UTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As told in the challenge, I assigned the value of COLLEGE to PWN with `=`
```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{QigPteLjlqqLB1RoQwzUomWvFKT.QX5UTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
You can write values to variables using `=` without putting any space between anything otherwise the shell will read the Variable name as command
