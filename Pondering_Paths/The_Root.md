# Challenge 1 : The_Root
The challenge is about the root directory and invoking programs present in it

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4M-jiULVJdNZZ0wWu62x0PLMKfV.QX4cTO0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As instructed in the challenge, I invoked the program by inputting the absolute path of 'pwn' by starting with `/`
```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4M-jiULVJdNZZ0wWu62x0PLMKfV.QX4cTO0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
