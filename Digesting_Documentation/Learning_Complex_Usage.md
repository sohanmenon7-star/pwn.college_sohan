# Challenge 2 : Learning Complex Usage
This challenge teaches you about arguments within an argument and to use it by giving the path of the flag as the second argument(Argument of argument)

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ojOIg-VOaQI2qQ6x985AXI1Yf9t.QX1ITO0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As explained in the description, I invoked the /challenge/challenge program and used `--printfile` as the argument and the path to the flag as the second argument
```
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{ojOIg-VOaQI2qQ6x985AXI1Yf9t.QX1ITO0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
I learnt that a command with an argument can have an argument within an argument and it when it needs to be used
