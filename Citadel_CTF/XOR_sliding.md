# Challenge: XOR Sliding
You realise that a previous climber has set up a puzzle in what was otherwise an empty room, blocking the entrance to the next floor on the ceiling. 
You must slide the blocks forming the pyramid to create a path above.

## Solution: 
- From the name of the challenge, it was obvious that the ciphertext was encoded with sliding xor
- So i gave the cipher text to AI and told it that it was encoded with xor sliding and to decrypt it
- Specifically to find the string which starts with 'citadel'
- This eventually gave me the flag
