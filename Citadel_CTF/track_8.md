# Challenge track *
Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. 
On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it:

twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}

When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchiko’s latest studio album,
particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.
## My solve
- I went on spotify and searched up Pachinkos latest album, It was 'Vinegar'
- This gave me the hint that we have to use Vigenère decoding of the random string of characters given
- Upon decoding it, I found the flag out
