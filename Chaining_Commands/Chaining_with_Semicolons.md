# Challenge 1 : Chaining with semicolons
This challenge requires you to run two programs together by chaining them using `;`

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ya75mK7A4MEdsM5MeJhQQb0ryB1.QX1UDO0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As told in the challenge, I simply used `;` to write both commands in the same line to obtain the flag
```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Ya75mK7A4MEdsM5MeJhQQb0ryB1.QX1UDO0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
I learnt that you can execute multiple commands in the same line by chaining them using `;` to seperate commands
