# Challenge 2 : Building on Success
This challenge requires you to use `&&` to chain two commands to obtain the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kIIZXo1G0yfOaY6CZhG5kRp-82a.0lM0MDOxwiM5kjNzEzW}`

As told in the challenge, I simply used `&&` to chain /challenge/first-success and /challenge/second to get the flag
```
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{kIIZXo1G0yfOaY6CZhG5kRp-82a.0lM0MDOxwiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
This challenge taught me how to use `&&` which chains only IF the first command succeeds
