# Challenge: Selected Ambient works
The symphonic adventure does not end here. On the next floor, a single song keeps echoing through the floor, repeating in a haunting loop. Amid the sound, you find a note left by a past candidate. It hints that the song holds a secret message, hidden in plain sight, much like how Aphex Twin concealed his face within his music with the help of spectrograms.

To move forward, you must find the message hidden in this sound.

Note: Separate the words in the flag with _ and make it UPPERCASE. Example: citadel{S3L3CT3D_AMB13NT_W0RK}

## Solution: 
- Upon listening to the .wav file, it was obvious that the audio was playing something in morse code
- I first decoded the graph of the .wav file to find the morse code present within a specific part of the program
- Once I got the morse code, I simply translated it online to find the flag words
