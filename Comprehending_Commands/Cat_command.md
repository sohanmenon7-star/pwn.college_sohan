# Challenge 1 : cat command
The challenge simply requires you to use `cat` to read a file in the home directory

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{s3IZPY7asnZBWWlLPHJeOtj6Mob.QXxcTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As told in the challenge, I simply used `cat` to the read the flag file
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{s3IZPY7asnZBWWlLPHJeOtj6Mob.QXxcTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
This challenge taught me about the command `cat`, and how it is used. I learnt `cat` can take multiple arguments and that if no argument is given it will accept input from the terminal and output it.
