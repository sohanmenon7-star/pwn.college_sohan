# Challenge 6 : Permission tweaking Practice
This challenge has 8 rounds of changing permission of a program to finally give the user ability to read the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0PPbt3AOIQFi9XG2q4ki4z1PqZH.QXwEjN0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

- As told in the challenge, I continously gave the specified permissions using `chmod`
- After 8 rounds, I obtained the power to change permission of /flag
- I made /flag readable and the obtained the flag
```

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
