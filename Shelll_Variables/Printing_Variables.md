# Challenge 1 : Printing Variables
This challenge asks you to print a variable which contains the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AJVM6aCw52vH0YHmhWjcJ1jTNsd.QX3UTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

As asked in the challenge I used `echo` with `$FLAG` as the argument to print the variable which gave me the flag
```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{AJVM6aCw52vH0YHmhWjcJ1jTNsd.QX3UTN0wiM5kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
- I learnt you can use `echo` to print variables, This is done by prepending the variable names with `$`
- Example, `$FLAG`
- I also learnt that the Linux command line (Shell) is a similar to programming langiage and can have variables
