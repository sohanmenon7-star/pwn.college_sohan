# Challenge 7 : Permission setting Practice
This challegne introduces the use of `=` and `,` to set permission for user owner and group owner and others to obtain the flag after a series a challenges like the previous challenge

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{83ANcgQE5VvX_c-7Iz3Q0mBM31w.QXzETO0wiM5kjNzEzW}`

Similar to the last challenge, I used `=`,`,` to set permission of /challenge/pwn as told in the rounds, to obtain the power to `chmod` /flag and obtain the flag
```

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod ugo=rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag

```

## What I learned 
I learned about `=` and `,`, which can be used to set permissions of u,g,o to as mentioned which overwrites the old permissions
